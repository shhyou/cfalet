# Locally Relax the Value Restriction by Control Flow Analysis
---
# Abstract

This project is aiming at relaxing the value restriction locally via flow analysis, where the value striction has long been the standard yet too restrictive solution to integrating Hindler-Milner style polymorphism with imperative features.

<!--
The value restriction has long been adopted as the standard solution to integrating Hindley-Milner style polymorphism with imperative features, yet the value restriction is too conservative in rejecting to generalize all non-value terms. In this project
we shall aim at relaxing the value restriction locally via control flow analysis.

# Motivation
- The value restriction refuses to generalize all non-value terms, hence rejecting procedures that compute polymorphic functions.

    * Also rejects polymorphic data structures

- Use of imperative features are rare; most of the computation are functionally pure.

---
# Challenges

- The value restriction is actually at a balance point that any extension could probably be unwillingly complex and break the module abstraction.

- Polymorphism has a bad interaction with imperative features such as mutable variable.

    ```javascript
    function unsound() {
      var mem = null;
      return function(x) {
        if (mem === null) {
          mem = x;
          return x;
        } else {
          var y = mem;
          mem = x;
          return y;
        }
      };
    }

    var mem = unsound();  /* mem : forall a. a -> a */
    var s = mem("hello"); /* mem "hello"  :  string */
    var n = 3 + mem(5);   /* disaster: adding number and string */
    ```

<!--
    ```ocaml
    fun unsound () =
      let val mem = ref NONE
      in  fn x => case !mem of
            NONE   => (mem := SOME x; x)
          | SOME y => (mem := SOME x; y)
      end

    val mem = unsound ()
    val s = mem "hello"
    val n = 3 + mem 5
    ```

# Potential Solutions
- Apply techniques from static program analysis, tracking type informations together with uses of imperative features.

  * The analysis shall basically follows the syntatic *shape* of the program.

  * Any spotted safe type variables should be generalized.

---
# Novelty
<!-- Static analysis and type systems are two extremes in program analysis. Most use cases of program analysis have been to guide compiler optimizations or --> Static analysis have been used to identify **potential** errors in the program, while type system <!-- provides a coarse abstraction of a program's runtime behavior but -->**proves** the absence of certain runtime errors.

.center[![static analysis and type system](./static-analysis-and-types.png)]

This project is an attempt to bring the two together so that some safe but non-provable programs shall be allowed without much modification to the original type system.

# Evaluation
Our concerns include

- Accepting more terms in practice, i.e. improve expressiveness

- Impact on compilation time
