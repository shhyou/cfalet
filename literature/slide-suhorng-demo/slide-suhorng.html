# The Problem 1/2

- Control Flow Analysis

    * Find the function call at a given program point (together with the relevant bindings)

    * Inseparable from data flow analysis, in contrast to non-higher-order languages

---
# The Problem 2/2

- Control flow analysis

    * It's **impossible** to determine the exact control flow

    * The approximation ought to be safe

    * Precision versus long run time

- Type system and control flow analysis are both one sort of **abstract interpretation**

---
# Methodology 1/2

- A parameterized collecting machine, given operationally.

    * For $M\in \mathit{CS}$, $\widehat{\mathit{eval}}(M) = \hat{C}$ if

        $\langle\mathcal C, \emptyset, \emptyset, \hat{C_0}, \emptyset \rangle \to^+ \langle \mathtt{halt}, \hat{E}, \hat{S}, \hat{C}, \emptyset \rangle$

- A variable allocation function, $\widehat{\mathit{new}}$, controlling precision

- A projection function, $\Theta$, controlling the speed

- Instantiating with different functions gives different analysis, e.g. 0-CFA, 1-CFA

---
# Methodology 2/2

- The collecting machine is sound, and is a unified framework. 

- We may probably infer the *pureness* of the expression from the control flow information.

# Evaluation 1/2
- Use the control flow information to enable more optimizations

.center[![benchmark](./bench-times.png)]

---
# Evaluation 2/2

- The benchmarks indeed included

    * Impact on compile-time and run-time speedup

    * Optimized procedures calls -- which is enabled by the proposed CFA

    * Eliminated closure construction, also requires control flow informations

---
# Applications and Future Work 1/2

- Being parameterized, the proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of analysis. The compiler may freely choose between precision and speed.

- Control flow information is essential to a plenty number of optimizations

    * Also possible to analyse OO languages

    * Higher-order languages are common nowaday: Scheme, Haskell, Standard ML, javascript, Python, Ruby, ...

---
# Applications and Future Work 2/2

- Can also *statically* check the safety of **scripting languages**

- Optimizations for both scripting language and compiled languages are desired

- Between theory and application: Compile-time consumption and precision; many analysis requires tuning
