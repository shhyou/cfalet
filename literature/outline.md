## (Required?) Outline
For each paper, create 9 slides to describe 

- Title for your research and title for the reference, where it comes from, authors, and your name (**p1**)
- Problems this reference tries to solve (**p2** and **p3**)
- Solutions it proposed (slide **p4** and **p5**)
- Evaluation (slide **p6** and **p7**)
- Applications and Future work (slide **p8** and **p9**)

In the even number of slides, simply summarize what they did. In the odd pages of the slides, try to answer the questions

## Slides Here
- p.2: Problems

- p.3

    * Is the problem clearly defined?

    * Is it a good research problem

    * Is the problem relevant to your research/interests? 

- p.4: Proposed Solutions

- p.5

    * Are they stated clearly? Can you describe them in a short paragraph?

    * Are the solutions sound and reasonable?

    * Can you use/modify their solutions to solve your problem?

- p.6: Evaluation

- p.7

    * Are their solutions carefully evaluated?

- p.8: Applications

- p.9

    * Applications

        + Why people care about such applications? Where does its value come from?

        + How big is the gap there between the existing theory and its final application? Is there any research value hiding behind such gap?
